## 📱 Overview

**Yummy** is a full-featured food ordering mobile application built with Flutter. It allows users to browse a rich menu of food products, search for items, add them to a cart, review their order history, and complete the checkout process — all wrapped in a clean and intuitive UI.

The app was developed using **Clean Architecture** principles, ensuring separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability. It integrates with a **REST API** for live data and gracefully falls back to **dummy/mock data** when the API is unavailable — keeping the experience seamless at all times.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Flutter** | Cross-platform UI framework |
| **Dart** | Programming language |
| **Clean Architecture** | Layered code structure (Data / Domain / Presentation) |
| **REST API** | Live backend data fetching |
| **Dummy/Mock Data** | Fallback when API is unavailable |
| **Local Storage** | Session & preferences persistence |
| **Custom Widgets** | Reusable UI components (buttons, text fields, snackbars) |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) `>=3.0.0`
- [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart) `>=3.0.0`
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter extension

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hamedrefaat1/Yummy_app.git
   cd Yummy_app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

> **Note:** If the API is unavailable, the app will automatically switch to dummy/mock data so you can still explore all features.

## 📡 API & Dummy Data

The app is designed to work with a REST API defined in `lib/core/constants/api_endpoints.dart`. All network requests are handled through the `networks` layer in the core module.

Since the API may occasionally be unavailable during development, **dummy data** has been added as a fallback across all features. This ensures:
- The UI is always testable
- All screens remain functional during demos
- Development can continue without a live backend

## 📂 Project Structure Highlights

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `lib/core/constants` | App-wide constants (colors, API endpoints) |
| `lib/core/networks` | HTTP client configuration & interceptors |
| `lib/core/utils` | Utility helpers (local storage, etc.) |
| `lib/features/*` | Individual feature modules (auth, home, cart, etc.) |
| `lib/shared` | Reusable widgets shared across features |
| `screenshots/` | App screenshots for documentation |
| `test/` | Unit and widget tests |
